        <p>Simply, you can say that inflation is a rate on how a price on something increases over time. Further explanation and examples are shown below.</p>

<h2 id="exam">Example</h2>

	<p id="ext">
	Let's say an orange cost $1.00 in 2023. And the inflation rate is 5% which is 5 cents($0.05). So, the apple in 2024 will cost $1.05. This is an explanation of how an inflation works. If you know how it works you may also have to know the impact of it. If you buy $20 of orange, you will get 20 oranges in 2023. After the time flies to 2024, you might buy $20 of oranges again, but this time you will only get about 19 oranges. That is the impact of it. The more the time goes, the more the prices increse. And you are getting less number of things as a result.
